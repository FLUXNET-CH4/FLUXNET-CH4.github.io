    "text": "FLUXNET-CH4 is an initiative led by the Global Carbon Project, in close partnership with AmeriFlux and EuroFlux, to compile a global database of eddy covariance (EC) methane flux measurements. Data are standardized, post-processed (i.e., partitioned and gap-filled), and released as FLUXNET-CH4 (Delwiche et al. 2021, Knox et al. 2019). FLUXNET-CH4 Version 1.0 includes data from 81 sites, representing freshwater, coastal, upland, natural, and managed ecosystems. The near continuous, high-frequency nature of EC measurements offers significant promise for improving our understanding of ecosystem-scale CH4 flux dynamics. FLUXNET-CH4 exists thanks to the hard work of the site teams who collected these data and their willingness to participate in the FLUXNET-CH4 effort. Please refer to the Data Policy page for data usage and acknowledgement requirements. Funding for the FLUXNET-CH4 initiative was provided by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the USGS Powell Center."
