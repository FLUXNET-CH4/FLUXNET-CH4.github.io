# FLUXNET-CH4 

FLUXNET-CH4 is an initiative led by the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/), in close partnership with [AmeriFlux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) and [EuroFlux](http://www.europe-fluxdata.eu/home), to compile a global database of eddy covariance (EC) methane flux measurements. On this webpage you will find more information about the initiative, [a link to the data set](https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet-ch4-community-product/), publications leveraging the dataset, and more information for those interested in submitting their data to FLUXNET-CH4 V2.0.
